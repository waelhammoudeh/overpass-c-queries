This is the TODO list for overpass-c-functions.

1) Fix raw data writing implementation! Think of curl func library exporting
   variables for debugging query. The client / user should not define this
   behaviour, the user should be able to just use do "#define DEBUG_QUERY" for
   this to work.

   Note: curl library can download data to disk, same data in memory can be
   written to disk with another call to curl perform function ... then you may
   not get the same response as the one before plus you have to make 2 calls
   to query server. This was NOT what I wanted. I implemented exactly what I
   wanted by writing recieved data as soon as I got it.
   
2) make WKT for found nodes GPS to draw them with QGIS.
