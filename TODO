This is the TODO list for overpass-c-functions.

1) Implement saving downloaded data to file on disk.

2) Get ride of code duplication in op-string.c file;
   *) data is the same as wget file, work from there ... make the data AS the file
   *) what about header files? internet - communication - headers?
   
3) Save all found nodes in an array, not just first found.

4) make WKT for found nodes GPS and draw them with QGIS.
